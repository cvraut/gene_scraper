Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis.

Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups and protein tyrosine kinase activity. An important paralog of this gene is IGF1R.","Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src-homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosine residues, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway, which is responsible for most of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, which regulates expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to phosphotyrosines on IRS1 leads to the activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger, which activates several PIP3-dependent serine/threonine kinases, such as PDPK1 and subsequently AKT/PKB. The net effect of this pathway is to produce a translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate glucose transport. Moreover, upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT/PKB is responsible for: anti-apoptotic effect of insulin by inducing phosphorylation of BAD; regulates the expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymes by controlling the activity of the winged helix or forkhead (FOX) class of transcription factors. Another pathway regulated by PI3K-AKT/PKB activation is mTORC1 signaling pathway which regulates cell growth and metabolism and integrates signals from insulin. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 thereby activating mTORC1 pathway. The Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway is mainly involved in mediating cell growth, survival and cellular differentiation of insulin. Phosphorylated IRS1 recruits GRB2/SOS complex, which triggers the activation of the Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway. In addition to binding insulin, the insulin receptor can bind insulin-like growth factors (IGFI and IGFII). Isoform Short has a higher affinity for IGFII binding.

Diseases associated with EYA2 include Syndromic Microphthalmia and Cardiomyopathy, Dilated, 1J. Among its related pathways are Homology Directed Repair and DNA Double Strand Break Response. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include magnesium ion binding and protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. An important paralog of this gene is EYA1.","Functions both as protein phosphatase and as transcriptional coactivator for SIX1, and probably also for SIX2, SIX4 and SIX5 (PubMed:12500905, PubMed:23435380). Tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates 'Tyr-142' of histone H2AX (H2AXY142ph) and promotes efficient DNA repair via the recruitment of DNA repair complexes containing MDC1. 'Tyr-142' phosphorylation of histone H2AX plays a central role in DNA repair and acts as a mark that distinguishes between apoptotic and repair responses to genotoxic stress (PubMed:19351884). Its function as histone phosphatase may contribute to its function in transcription regulation during organogenesis. Plays an important role in hypaxial muscle development together with SIX1 and DACH2; in this it is functionally redundant with EYA1 (PubMed:12500905). EYA2_HUMAN,O00167",,

BMP7,Gene - Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7,"This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer, which plays a role in bone, kidney and brown adipose tissue development. Additionally, this protein induces ectopic bone formation and may promote fracture healing in human patients. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]",BMP7 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with BMP7 include Renal Fibrosis and Spondylolisthesis. Among its related pathways are MIF Mediated Glucocorticoid Regulation and GPCR Pathway. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include cytokine activity and heparin binding. An important paralog of this gene is BMP5.,"Growth factor of the TGF-beta superfamily that plays important role in various biological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and skeletal morphogenesis (PubMed:31208997). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor ACVR1 and type II receptor ACVR2A (PubMed:9748228, PubMed:12667445). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, ACVR2A phosphorylates and activates ACVR1. In turn, ACVR1 propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:12478285). For specific functions such as growth cone collapse in developing spinal neurons and chemotaxis of monocytes, uses also BMPR2 as type II receptor (PubMed:31208997). Can also signal through non-canonical pathways such as P38 MAP kinase signaling cascade that promotes brown adipocyte differentiation through activation of target genes, including members of the SOX family of transcription factors (PubMed:27923061).

MAFF,Gene - MAF BZIP Transcription Factor F,"The protein encoded by this gene is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that lacks a transactivation domain. It is known to bind the US-2 DNA element in the promoter of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) gene and most likely heterodimerizes with other leucine zipper-containing proteins to enhance expression of the OTR gene during term pregnancy. The encoded protein can also form homodimers, and since it lacks a transactivation domain, the homodimer may act as a repressor of transcription. This gene may also be involved in the cellular stress response. Multiple transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.
